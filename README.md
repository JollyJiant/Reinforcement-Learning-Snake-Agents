# Reinforcement-Learning-Snake-Agents

My final project for CS 401R - Reinforcement Learning. I wrote 3 different reinforcement learning algorithms to test different agents' abilities to learn and play Snake. I chose Q-Learning, Polociy Iteration, and Actor-Critic because to showcase the difference between Policy-based, Value-based and Hybrid algorithms. I compared the average performance of the algorithms across 10 games of Snake, and found that Q-Learning was the best performing in terms of training time and final score.
